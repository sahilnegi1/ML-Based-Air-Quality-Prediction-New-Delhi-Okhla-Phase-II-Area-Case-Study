Computers can now learn without being explicitly programmed thanks to the discipline of machine learning.One of the most intriguing technologies ever is machine learning. As the name suggests, it gives computers what makes them more human: the ability to learn. Contrary to popular belief, there are now more applications for machine learning.Deep learning may be divided into four primary categories: reinforcement learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning.

Supervised learning: Learning which contains labeled dataset this learning already knows the output, regression and classification are its type. The method that builds a mathematical representation of a dataset with both intended inputs and outputs. A collection of training samples make up the so-called training data. Each training example contains a desired output, also known as a monitor signal, and one or more inputs. The algorithm can accurately estimate outputs for inputs that are not included in the training data when it performs at its best. Algorithms are considered to have learnt to do a job when they gradually increase the accuracy of their outputs or predictions.

Unsupervised learning: An algorithm that learn from unlabeled, unclassified, or uncategorized test data. Unsupervised learning algorithm detect patterns hidden in the data and for each new data it respond depending on such patterns. Unsupervised learning has several uses, including determining probability density functions in the field of density estimation in statistics. However, unsupervised learning also encompasses other areas that summarize and describe properties of data. Although many machine learning researchers have shown that mixing unlabeled data with sparse quantities of labeled data considerably enhances learning accuracy, even when some training examples lack training labels.

Semi-supervised learning: The learning which lies between Supervised and Unsupervised learning is Semi Supervised Learning. Although many machine learning researchers have shown that mixing unlabeled data with sparse quantities of labeled data considerably enhances learning accuracy, even when some training examples lack training labels.

Reinforcement learning: the area of machine learning that examines how software agents need to act in various contexts to maximise the idea of cumulative reward. In machine learning, the environment is usually represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Dynamic programming is a common component in reinforcement learning techniques. When a precise model of the MDP cannot be established, reinforcement learning techniques are applied. These algorithms do not need knowledge of the exact mathematical model of the MDP. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used when learning to play games against human opponents and self-driving cars.
III.	Machine Learning  Role In Air Quality Prediction
In the study of air quality prediction, many models and techniques have been used those are Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Classifier. A brief description of each model and its studies is provided.

Linear Regression
One of the simplest, and Most used Machine Learning Algorithm.
This method is a statistical technique used for predictive analytics. This method is used for data with continuous or numerical variables lets understand this algorithm with example, predicting employee Salary with respect to his Years of Experience. Linear regression produces predictions on the basis of linear connection between a dependent (y) variable and one or more independent (x) variables. Hence it is called linear regression. It shows how X and Y are related. Linear Regression looks at how X and Y values are changing.
Linear regression model provides a straight line that represents the relationship between variables.

Linear regression algorithm types:

Simple Linear Regression
When just one X is used to predict the value of Y, where X is independent variable and Y is dependent variable.
Example Years of Experience use to predict Salary of Employee.

Multiple Linear Regression
When more than one X is used to predict the value of Y, where X is independent variable and Y is dependent variable.
Example Engine size and number of cylinders use to predict Emission of Carbon Dioxide

Decision Tree Regression:
Decision Trees are a sort of supervised machine learning algorithm using true or false responses to a given question, that are trained using AutoML tools to classify or regress data. The resulting structure looks like a tree with different types of nodes like root node, inner node, and leaf node. The decision tree begins at the root node and branches out into internal and leaf nodes. The final categories or actual values are found in the leaf nodes.

Random Forest Regression:
Random Forest is a well-known machine learning algorithm that uses supervised learning methods. Both classification and regression issues may be solved with it. It is built on the idea of ensemble learning, which mixes many classifiers to address complicated issues and enhance model functionality.

Support Vector Regression:
Support vector algorithm is used for both Classification and Regression. Where Classification is used for Categorical data and Regression is used to define relationship between X and Y variable. Support Vector Regression and SVM have same principle. The goal of Support Vector machine is to find maximum marginal plane between two different data points. The hyperplane is the best line fitting in two different data points, The Data Point are the support vectors. Example Detecting face in image. 

KNN (K Nearest Neighbor):
KNN is K Nearest Neighbor, is a nonparametric supervised learning classifier that use proximity to classify or predict groups of data points. It is a classification technique that finds the close related points.

Support Vector Classifier:
The supervised machine learning technique known as the SVC, or Support Vector Classifier, is often used for classification problems. SVC separates the data into two classes by mapping the data points into a high-dimensional space and locating the ideal hyperplane.
